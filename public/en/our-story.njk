  - Hello, I'm Sandra!
  - My journey began when I was working as a waitress at a hotel chain. At the time, the executive chef had an events company that he managed in his free time. One day, he asked me to help him with one of his private events, and thanks to my passion for sales and customer service, I accepted without hesitation. After that event, many people started reaching out to me to help with their private gatherings.
  - Over time, I decided to embark on my own path in the events industry. I started by offering planning and setup services with the goal of creating unique and personalized experiences for every client. My dedication and hard work helped me build a loyal customer base, and soon, word-of-mouth recommendations began opening new doors. That’s how this wonderful business started to grow.
  - Some time later, I met my husband, Alfredo, who decided to join the project. With his contagious energy and outstanding customer service, we became an unstoppable team. Alfredo took charge of the bar service, bringing his charisma and enthusiasm to every event, while I focused on the planning and setup details. Together, we offer comprehensive event solutions—from full event organization to personalized bar services—designing custom packages tailored to each client’s needs.
  - "Today, almost 20 years later and with over 1,000 events completed since we started in 2005, we continue working with the same love and dedication that drove us from the beginning. Our motto has always been: 'Specialists in event setup. Expert hands, impeccable service.' We are passionate about taking care of every detail and creating unique moments that stay in the hearts of our clients."
  - "Our dream is to keep growing and establish ourselves as the top choice for full-scale event setups in South Florida. Every event we organize is special, and we look forward to creating many more unforgettable memories for years to come."
