faq:
  heading: Q&A
  items:
    - question: What are the delivery and return times for rental items?
      answer: Items can be picked up the day before the event and must be returned the following day. If not returned on time, an additional charge of $20 per day of delay will apply. For same-day deliveries and pickups, additional fees will apply. If you have more questions or need clarification, feel free to contact us. We're here to help! ðŸ˜Š
    - question: Loss and damage policy
      answer: The client assumes full responsibility for the items from the moment they receive or pick them up until they are returned to our premises. To avoid additional charges, it is important not to expose the items to weather conditions that could cause damage. In case of loss, breakage, or deterioration, the client will need to cover 100% of the replacement costs. Please note that our insurance does not cover the items while they are outside of our custody and control.
    - question: How do you handle payments?
      answer: We accept cash and Zell payments. To secure your reservation, we require a 50% deposit of the total agreed amount. The remaining balance must be paid before or on the event date. Without the deposit, we cannot guarantee the reservation. In case of event cancellation, the deposit is non-refundable. Once the items are delivered, full payment must be completed, regardless of whether some items are not used during the event.
    - question: What happens if I need to cancel?
      answer: If you need to cancel, you can do so up to one week before the event. However, the deposit is non-refundable.
    - question: Does the price include taxes and delivery costs?
      answer: No, the prices listed on our website do not include taxes or delivery costs, as these vary by client. Specific costs will be detailed in the invoice or estimate we send you once the request is made.
